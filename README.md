## Project inspiration
Having teammates from diverse cultures and country of origins, we found a common issue regarding the accessibility to financial literacy.With just one search having so much random information thrown at you could be confusing for a lot of people, especially with language as an additional barrier.

## Project Goal
Our project goal is rooted in our shared mission to empower individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds with essential financial knowledge. Our objective is crystal clear: to provide accessible, tailored financial guidance. Through our efforts, we aspire to transform the journey to financial literacy into an inclusive and empowering experience for everyone
