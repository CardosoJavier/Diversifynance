## Project inspiration
Having friends & family from diverse cultures and different countries of origin, we found a common issue regarding the accessibility towards learning financial literacy, but with Diversifynance language barriers are no more!

## Project Goal
Our project goal is rooted in our shared mission to empower individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds with little to no access to financial education. Our objective is crystal clear: to provide accessible, tailored financial guidance with through our efforts, we aspire to transform the journey to financial literacy into an inclusive and empowering experience for everyone.

## Diversifynance Future
Our team is planning to incorporate a sophiscated algorithm to automate web scraping. In this way, the users relying on our app will have access to up-to-date information about the most important financial institutions and their available services. Also, we are looking towars integrating a wider variety of languages in the app.
